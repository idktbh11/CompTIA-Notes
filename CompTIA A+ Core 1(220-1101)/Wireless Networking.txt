Wi-Fi is actually referring to wireless networking that's based on a set of standards by an IEEE group called 802.11.
In the wireless space, there's a whole bunch of set of rules or protocols in the 802.11 space that allows 2 devices to communicate with each other.

Access Point Options:   Autonomous Mode/Thick/Full - Mode that makes the access point do all the work itself when you deploy it.
			Lightweight Mode - Mode that just sends signals back and forth between devices. Let's a Controller do all the work
			




Controller -  A device/software that manages and controls multiple access points.
Vendor - A company that makes and sells networking equipment like routers, access points, and controllers.

802.11 standards:  802.11n(2.4/5 Hz, 72 to 600 bits), 802.11ac(5 Hz, 433 to 6933 bits), 802.11ax(2.4/5/6 Hz, 600 to 9608 bits), 802.11be(2.4/5/6 Hz, 40000 bits)


Hertz - Measures Frequency - How many times something happens in one second.

Bits -  How much information/data is being sent or received over the network.

WPA - A Wi-Fi security protocol that protects wireless networks

Versions:
	WPA1(not very strong by today's standards)
	WPA2(Uses stronger encryption, AES)
	WPA3(Newest and most secure version. It adds even better protection against hacking, especially on public Wi-Fi.)
