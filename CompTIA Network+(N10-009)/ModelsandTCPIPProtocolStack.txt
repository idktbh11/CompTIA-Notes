TCP/IP Protocol Stack - A simplified version of the OSI model used in real-world networking.  It has 4 layers.

Layers :
	1. Link Layer – Handles physical connections and data transfer over hardware (like Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
	2. Internet Layer – Finds the best path for data using IP addresses (like the OSI Network layer).
	3. Transport Layer – Ensures data arrives correctly and in order using TCP (reliable) or UDP (faster but less reliable).
	4. Application Layer – Handles user-facing services (like web browsers, email).
