Security controls are measures put in place to protect systems, data, and people from threats.
Security controls can be loosely grouped by category (how the control is implemented) and by type (why the control is implemented).



(How)
Categories : 
1. Via a system(Technical Control)
2. Via a policy/procedure(Managerial Control)
3. Via a person/human(Operational Control)
4. Via a physical lock/gateway/guard(Physical Control)

(Why)
[Types of Controls]
Deterrent – Discourages threats from happening (e.g., security cameras).
Preventive – Stops threats before they happen (e.g., firewalls).
Detective – Identifies threats when they happen (e.g., security alarms).
Corrective – Fixes issues after a threat happens (e.g., restoring from a backup).
Directive – Tells people what to do to prevent threats (e.g., security policies).
Compensating – Makes up for weaknesses in other controls (e.g., using two-factor authentication if a password is weak).
